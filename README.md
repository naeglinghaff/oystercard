# Oystercard

A program simulating the oystercard system in London. 


## How to test

```
rspec
````

or 

```
ruby feature_test.rb
```


## User Test

```
In order to use public transport
As a customer
I want money on my card
```

Feature test:

```
card.balance
```

This should not return errors and should return the amount of money we have on the card. 

Created a unit test to see if it would accept the method and then match it to an attribute of the Oystercard class.
